# Forever Unfinished: The Portfolio of Remington Braninburg

### The Journey
This repository is more than a collection of files; it is the culmination of a climb. The road to this portfolio was built through seasons of homelessness—a period that would have crumbled many, but instead provided the fire to forge my skills. 

I taught myself HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript when the world offered no stability, no warmth, no rest. As the saying goes though I am truly wicked, so im not complaing.

I found clarity in the logic of code and the expression of digital art. Every line of syntax here was earned. I am eternally grateful for the hardship, it allowed me to scream silently into the digital ether and feel heard in a world that had all but taken everything and turned its back. at the same time, it stripped away the noise and taught me that I am capable of building a future from nothing but a screen and a vision.

### What You’ll Find Here: My Forever Unfinished journey of humility and growth...
* **Digital & Traditional Art:** Fusing graffiti aesthetics with modern tech.
* **Web3 Integration:** Exploring the utility of NFT collections like *kguitchyerglitchen*.
* **Development:** Self-taught front-end architecture and LLM experimentation.

The doors are now open. Welcome to my work.

# Forever Unfinished: The Portfolio of Faux-Fuax

### The Journey
> This repository is more than a collection of files; it is the culmination of a climb. The road to this portfolio was built through seasons of homelessness—a period that would have crumbled many, but instead provided the fire to forge my skills.

I taught myself HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript when the world offered no stability, no warmth, and no rest. But as they say, there is no rest for the wicked, so I’m not complaining.

I found clarity in the logic of code and the expression of digital art. Every line of syntax here was earned. I am eternally grateful for the hardship; it allowed me to scream silently into the digital ether and feel heard. It stripped away the noise and taught me that I am capable of building a future from nothing but a screen and a vision.

### What You’ll Find Here
* **Digital & Traditional Art:** Fusing graffiti aesthetics with modern tech.
* **Web3 Integration:** Exploring the utility of NFT collections like *kguitchyerglitchen*.
